                    I am a Computer Science engineer currently studying in VIT Vellore. I have a good understanding of
                    computer science and I am currently learning web development and Java. I have also learnt Machine
                    Learning and Deep Learning. I have done many short term online courses as well as have participated
                    in many other hackathons from MLH, VIT Hack and other small hacks. I along with my team won a
                    hackathon organised by C4 Chapter of VIT. Our project was based on predicting mortality and
                    morbidity of Covid-19. I personally and also with my team have built many projects. During my
                    internship at Ericsson, I worked on Docker and made a continerised Flask-MySQL application.
                    I am trying to increase and develop my skills in all ways and in all the fields as much as possible.

                <h1><u>About Me</u></h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Devang Mehrotra and I'm studying computer science and engineering in VIT-Vellore. I have done
                    my
                    schooling from Amity International School, Gurgaon. I have always had a keen interest in the field
                    of computer science. I have a good understanding of Machine Learning and aspire to excel in it. To
                    support my interests, I have done many short term online courses as well as have participated in
                    many other hackathons from MLH, VIT Hack and other small hacks. My team came first in a hackathon
                    organised by C4 Chapter of VIT. Our project was based on predicting mortality and morbidity of
                    Covid-19. I have built many projects and also worked on Docker. During my internship at Ericsson, I
                    worked on containerization of a Flask-MySQL application using Docker and learnt a lot about DevOps
                    during my internship. I have also learnt Deep Learning and I am currently learning web development
                    and trying to increase and develop my skills in all ways and in all the fields as
                    possible.</p>
