        <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni (born 7 July 1981), is a former Indian
            international cricketer who captained the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017
            and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC World Twenty20,
            the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A
            right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, Dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in One Day
            Internationals (ODIs) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective "finisher" in
            limited-overs formats. <br>He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wicket-keeper batsmen and
            captains in the history of the game.He was also the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings in ODI
            cricket.</p>
