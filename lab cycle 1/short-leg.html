            an occasional right-arm off break bowler, he plays for Delhi in first-class cricket and Delhi Capitals in
            the IPL. He played for the Indian Under-17 and Under-19 teams before making his first-class debut for Delhi
            in November 2004. At the 2015 World Cup, Dhawan was the leading run-scorer for India[4] and in the following
            year, became the fastest Indian to reach 3,000 ODI runs. In December 2017, he became the 2nd fastest Indian
            to reach 4000 ODI runs. Dhawan also holds the record for most runs in a calendar year in Twenty20
            International cricket (689). He is known for his successful and crucial knocks in ICC Tournaments.</p>
