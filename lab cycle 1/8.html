                <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking
                    a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form
                    of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly
                    called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries);
                    gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
                    rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.
                    These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as
                    football codes.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football">Wikipedia</a></p>
                <p>The Messi–Ronaldo rivalry is a football rivalry between fans of Argentine forward Lionel Messi
                    and Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo and supposedly between the players themselves.
                    Having won multiple awards, both are widely regarded not only as the two best players of
                    their generation, but also, by most in the sport, including players, writers and fans, as
                    two of the greatest of all time. They are two of the most decorated football players ever
                    during their senior careers thus far, and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single
                    season. They are amongst the 29 players in the history of the sport to score over 500 career goals,
                    with both having scored over 700 goals each in their careers for club and country.

                <p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football
                    competition contested by the senior men's national teams of the members of the Fédération
                    Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body.
                    The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
                    except in 1942 and 1946 when it was not held because of the Second World War.
                    The current champion is France, which won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.
