                    Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a
                    usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often
                    various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
                    which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is
                    sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

                    In Italy, pizza served in formal settings, such as at a restaurant, is presented unsliced, and is
                    eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3] In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to
                    be eaten while held in the hand.

                <p>The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian
                    town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the
                    dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most
                    popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at
                    pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, and via
                    pizza delivery.[5][6] Many companies sell ready-baked frozen pizzas to be reheated in an ordinary
                    home oven.</p>
